I am a first-year computer science PhD student in the Hybrid Intelligence (HI) Lab([https://hybrid-intelligence-lab.webspace.durham.ac.uk/]) at Durham University working with Asst. Prof. Yang Long. During my wonderful Masterâ€™s studies in Newcastle University, I was fortunate enough to work with Prof. Paolo Missier and A.P. Yu Guan. I obtained my B.S from Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, under the supervision of Prof. HongYe Xiao.
