[Prof. Yang Long]([https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=IrkuknEAAAAJ&hl=en](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/yang-long/). During my wonderful Masterâ€™s studies in Newcastle University, I was fortunate enough to work with [Prof. Paolo Missier](https://sites.google.com/site/paolomissier/) and [A.P.
